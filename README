qk2 - (9) quake 2
=================
port of linux/x11 quake2 to plan9front. tested on amd64 and 386 only.
currently lacks music and has a breaker bug with non 4:3 resolutions.
performance-wise, it works fairly well on VESA with lower resolutions, e.g.
800x600. on my machines.


installation
------------
besides building and installation, qk2 needs the data from its retail cd. those
are to be installed in $home/lib/quake2/baseq2. in a complete install, that
directory will contain pak^(0 1 2)^.pak, as well as the players and video
directories. neither players (for single play) nor video are mandatory. all
filenames should be lowercased.

; mk install
; mkdir -p $home/lib/quake2/baseq2/^(players video)
; cd /n/quake2cd/baseq2/
; cp *.pak $home/lib/quake2/baseq2/
; for(i in (players video)){ dircp $i $home/lib/quake2/baseq2/$i }


quake2 mods
-----------
quake2 mods are C code built as shared libraries (called "game modules"). here,
the code will have to be ported to plan9, adapted to qk2, then built and loaded
against it. this repo contains the code for the official ctf mod, the two
expansions, and a mod. for the rest of this file, let $mod the name of a mod.
the data for the mod is to be stored in $home/lib/quake2/$mod/.


installing a mod
----------------
a makefile is provided with each mod. "baseq2" is the main game.
for example, for ctf:

; mkfile -f mkfile.ctf install

or:

; bind mkfile.ctf mkfile
; mk install

each mod is built as a library, later linked to the rest of the common code.

; q2ctf +set game ctf +set ctf 1


porting a mod
-------------
in the case you wish to play a mod which has not been ported, and have nothing
better to do, you will need to port it yourself. fwiw, ctf and crbot-1.0 took
me about 4-5 hours each (not including debugging). note that all of this
assumes the mod only alters code for the game module (game/). if that's not
the case, no standard operational procedure exists.

having obtained the $mod's source code, you can use game/*.[ch] as reference
for your porting efforts. one thing specific to qk2 is how header files are
handled: most common headers, including game/q_shared.h, were merged into dat.h
and fns.h. game/[gp]*.h were merged into game/game.h. game/game.h is
unfortunately included in dat.h, as some required structure definitions vary
from mod to mod. as such, a mod is required to have $mod/game.h, which defines
anything necessary for common code to work.

you'll also need to write mkfiles (cf. mod installation instructions above).


todo/bugs
---------
- rendering glitches and fault reads on resolutions not originally supported
  (anything other than 4:3)
- edict_t definitions merged without much looking
- sys.c: stupid posixish glob stuff
- udp.c mostly horrid; need to rewrite networking stuff to use plan9 semantics
- garbled stdout (Sys_ConsoleOutput): \r instead of \n
- cinematic palette is fucked up if you resize during playback
- sound only (sortof) works thanks to shitty workarounds; in particular, sound
  buffer seems to be overwritten as its being written to /dev/audio
- multiplayer menu bugs: memory leaks and bugged map list
- compliling with -DPARANOID reveals hidden truths
- video menu doesn't make sense anymore; options menu includes deprecated crap
- (bjnh) clean up code more, plan9 C style everywhere
- (bjnh) better performance, use asm from original release
- (bjnh) redesign everything to be super cool


differences with linux/x11 quake2
---------------------------------
- mouse wheel up and down recognized and useable (but parsing is ugly)
- mouse buttons have (correct) plan9 names
- arbitrary resolutions up to 4096x4096 allowed (dat.h) and resize by dragging
  window edges; no fullscreen
- no dynamic linking â†’ "modules" are statically linked
- merged headers: dat.h,fns.h,game/game.h
- m_windowed cvar and IN_Grabm() for mouse grabbing
- ungrabs mouse when menu or console are opened
- removed some useless sys cvars
- mproc stuff for not letting mouse escape too often whenever the use swipes it
  probably sucks
