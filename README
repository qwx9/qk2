qk2 - (9) quake 2
=================
	- game data dirs are stored in $home/lib/quake2/, e.g. $home/lib/quake2/dicks/
	- 386 and amd64 only


horrors
-------
	- #pragma pack on set globally!!!
	- rendering glitches and fault reads on resolutions not originally supported
	  (4:3 and SXGA)
	- edict_t definitions merged without much looking
	- q_sh9: stupid posixish glob stuff
	- net_udp mostly horrid
	- portme: cd_9
	- garbled stdout (Sys_ConsoleOutput): \r instead of \n
	- dedicated 1: input not working (Sys_ConsoleInput)
	- race between mproc and IN_Commands
	- cinematic palette is fucked up if you resize during playback
	- sound only works thanks to shitty workarounds
	- bad/unsafe rename() implementation
	- ctf is untouched, so are rogue, xatrix
