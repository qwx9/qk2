qk2 - (9) quake 2
=================
	- installation
		. mk install
		. mkdir -p $home/lib/quake2/baseq2
		. dircp /n/quake2cd/baseq2 $home/lib/quake2/baseq2
	- game dir for gamemode "dicks" is stored in $home/lib/quake2/dicks/
	- tested on 386 and amd64 only

horrors
-------
	- rendering glitches and fault reads on resolutions not originally
	  supported (anything other than 4:3)
	- edict_t definitions merged without much looking
	- plan9/misc.c: stupid posixish glob stuff
	- plan9/udp.c mostly horrid
	- portme: cd_9
	- garbled stdout (Sys_ConsoleOutput): \r instead of \n
	- cinematic palette is fucked up if you resize during playback
	- sound only (sortof) works thanks to shitty workarounds
	- ctf is untouched, so are rogue, xatrix

differences with linux/x11 quake2
---------------------------------
	- mouse wheel up and down recognized and useable (but parsing is ugly)
	- mouse buttons have (correct) plan9 names
	- arbitrary resolutions up to 4096x4096 allowed (ref/r_local.h) and
	  resize by dragging window edges
	- no dynamic linking â†’ "modules" are statically linked
