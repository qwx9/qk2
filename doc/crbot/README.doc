COMMENTS
--------
 This is the final source code for latest version of CRbot! Including CTF
and full teamplay support. Enjoy.
 This package includes not only the source code for CRbot, but all related 
files from original ID Software source code distribution as well. I changed 
some of them and don't exactly remember which ones, sorry you'll have to figure\
it out yourself too. :)
 This source code provided AS IS, with no warranty of any kind, blah blah 
blah. Feel free to do whatever you want with it, there is only one condition:
I don't provide any kind of support, I don't answer questions and I don't 
tutor on how to create mods for Quake2. Otherwise I would be glad to
hear about any further modifications you'll do to it. And of course it is 
covered by original ID Software license, which you can find in the file named
LICENSE.TXT. 
 And one last thing: if you'll decide to use CRbot's source code in your own 
mod, don't forget to give me some credit, ok? Or, you know, your karma might 
suffer. :) Or at least send me your site's URL, so I can link to it from 
CRbot's main page.
